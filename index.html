                <p>
                    Around 9:30AM, calls made to <b>[REDACTED]</b> police department reporting loud bang 
                    outside residential neighborhood. Upon arrival, officers noticed smoke plumes outside 
                    <b>[REDACTED]</b> family farmhouse. Further inspection into the farm's fields revealed
                    what seemed to be a crash site. Officers on-site reported an unusual smell. Local ATC 
                    was contacted by Sheriff <b>[REDACTED]</b> to check if any flights lost contact. I 
                    arrived on site at 9:52AM on behalf of the <b>[REDACTED]</b> Defense Agency. The site 
                    was closed off to non-agency staff for further investigation.
                
                    <br> <br>
                
                    Around 8:30PM, rattling was heard originating at the crash site.
                    Special Team 22 was assigned to investigate. Check Report 44b for more details.

                <p>
                    The rattling from the previous night persisted into the morning. Special Team 22
                    was unable to detect any unusual EM activity (<i>Report 44c</i>) radiating from 
                    the capsule.
                </p>
                

                Around 6:30PM, the rattling intensified and a sound was observed alongside the
                rattling. Special Team 22 observed spikes in EM activity (<em>Report 44d</em>).

                <p>
                    At approximately 5:23AM, the rattling and sound abruptly stopped. Special Team 22,
                    however, observed increased EM activity (<i>Report 45a</i>). 
                
                </p>
                
                    At 5:28AM, a creature broke the capsule's exterior and fled. Observers described
                    the creature as black with multiple legs. Special Team 31 was assigned to track
                    the creature. <br> <br>

                    Due to the incident occuring early in the morning, no observers besides Special Team
                    22 and Special team 31 were present. The site was promptly cleaned up and the capsule
                    was taken to <b>[REDACTED]</b> Facility for further inspection. The <b>[REDACTED]</b>
                    family was awarded a grant of $400,000 for damages and disturbances and agreed to
                    sign a non-disclosure agreement with criminal consequences for violation of terms.
